description: This figure shows three sea surface height (SSH) patterns in the Gulf of Mexico generated using the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and 20 years SSH satellite data. These patterns are also the statistical pattern of Loop Current: (P1) normal; (P2) extension; (P3) retraction. Top numbers are corresponding occurrence percentage. Vectors are geostrophic current. Green line is 0.45 m SSH contour line. Cyan lines are 1000 m isobaths.

From the analysis, we found the Loop Current status is related to the upstream wind forcing and Pacific climate. This work has been published in Remote Sensing Letters. More details can be found
