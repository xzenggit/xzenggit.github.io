description: This figure shows the model simulated sediment accumulation rate (log10 cm/year). In this work, we used the Regional Ocean Modeling System to simulate the Huanghe and Changjiang Rivers-derived sediment transport in the Bohai, Yellow, and East China Seas. We estimated the sediment fluxes and analysed related mechanism for the sediment transport in this region. This work has been published in Continental Shelf Research.
