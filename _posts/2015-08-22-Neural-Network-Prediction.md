description: This figure shows two snapshots of comparison between observed and predicted Loop Current (LC) status using Artifical Neural Networks(ANN). Black lines are 1000-m isobaths. Red areas are the LC and LC eddies. Green solid lines LC and LC eddy edges. Green dashed lines are the track of Tropical Storm Don during 27â€“30 July 2011. Generally, the ANN-based model can capture the LC variation and eddy shedding process 4 weeks ahead, and in some cases, 5 and 6 weeks ahead is possible. This
