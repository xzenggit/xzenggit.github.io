description: This figure shows the model simulated surface velocity (vectors) and relative vorticity (color shading) in the South Atlantic Bight on Nov. 26, 2009. Note that, there's a large Gulf Stream offshore meander at the black box. In this work, we used forward and adjoint ocean models to simulate and explore the Gulf Stream meanders in the South Atlantic Bight. We found the interaction between upstream water transport variation and local bathymetry is responsile for the Gulf Stream meanders in this region. This work is almost done.
